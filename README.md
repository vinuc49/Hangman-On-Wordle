# HANGMAN ON WORDLE

Hangman is a game usually played by two or more people, where one person thinks of a word while the others guess what the word is by guessing one letter at a time until the whole word is revealed.
For this project I wanted to create a version of this game that you can play against the computer rather than playing against another person.
This is done by using python to generate the word and check if the user's guesses are correct, incorrect, invalid or if the user has already guessed the letter.

[Here is the live version of my project]() 

# How to play

- If you know how to play the game you can start the game, otherwise you can read about how to play the game.

- You will have to choose on which category to select

- You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find.

- Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with vowels).

- If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the answer where that letter appears will be revealed.

- After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters.

- Every time you guess a letter wrong you lose a life and the hangman begins to appear, piece by piece.

- To win you need to solve the puzzle before the hangman dies.
