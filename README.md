# Hangman on wordle

Hangman is a game usually played by two or more people, where one person thinks of a word while the others guess what the word is by guessing one letter at a time until the whole word is revealed.
For this project I wanted to create a version of this game that you can play against the computer rather than playing against another person.
This is done by using python to generate the word and check if the user's guesses are correct, incorrect, invalid or if the user has already guessed the letter.
